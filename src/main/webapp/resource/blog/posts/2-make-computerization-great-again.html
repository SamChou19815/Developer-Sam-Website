<p>I shall first thank the leaders of the first generation, Henry and Ben, for their excellent service to the great club
    of Computerization and for the students in our school. It was their ingenuity that resulted in the creation of SAM,
    a platform that covered 40% of students. I was able to successfully and peacefully handle the transition of power
    thanks to their cooperation.</p>
<p>In the last year when I led the club, Computerization became a club that defied others’ expectation. We expanded
    SAM’s user base, created new features, and started the early march to the ultimate challenge of artificial
    intelligence. We grew from a picayune in the middle of nowhere to an organization emerging victorious.</p>
<p>But the blog post was written at the moment of crisis for our club. I want to present the facts to all of us who want
    to tackle the problem instead of concealing them with fancy words. If you want all those politically correct ideas
    about unrealistic dreams without putting into notoriously demanding hard work, you can close the page and find those
    ones with admirable titles to suit your need. Here I will present those facts.</p>
<p>We were frustrated by the failure of programming teaching, humiliated by the bugs of recent UI update, and
    demoralized by the lack of progress for almost half a year. It was only half of the problem that plagues us
    nowadays. From the outside, other organization, which has a proven history of saying anything but do nothing, pushed
    our members to participate their hackathon. As a veteran who has seen the growth of Computerization, I want to
    clearly and honestly express my personal feeling when I see our influence has decayed to such an extent: It is
    unacceptable! And it should be the other way around!</p>
<p>Inside the club, we see failure and frustration. Outside the club, we see humbleness and humiliation. However, these
    problems that we faced today will no longer exist if we have a leadership that is independent and strong.</p>
<p>In the last year, as the president of Computerization, I was dedicated to the independence of our club. I strongly
    object to the interference from the outside, no matter if it is the request to establish surveillance, or the
    “friendly invitation” to develop the apps that school wants but not students need. I have donated half of the latest
    obtained scholarship fund, worth RMB 6000, to the great club of Computerization because I believe only with the
    strength of the fund can we defend ourselves against the intrusion to a group of censors, critics, and cynics.
    Therefore, I believe for now Computerization has kept its independence well.</p>
<p>However, for the strong leadership, it is a completely different story. Our club successfully recruited 29 new
    members, many of them lacking essential programming skills. We promised at the time of recruitment that they will
    become great software engineers. We failed the promise. The teachers at the course failed to provide a course that
    is comprehensible to ordinary students who had no exposure to the field of computer science. Some students at the
    course, as a natural result, started to play video games to protest or to argue against the ineffective course of
    nonsense! The whole club was in the atmosphere of depression, desperation, and devastation because we did not know
    how to move on with the unbelievable reality that is supposed to happen in those third-world trashy clubs.</p>
<p>The reason for that failure is that we no longer believe our original Yankee spirit, which reads “We are the ones who
    defy others’ expectation. We are the ones who turn the dream into truth.” For so many times of failure, we gradually
    accept the seemed new normals: a bleak future and a promise that was predicted to fail. The outsiders will laugh and
    tease us: your spirit is gone, accept your fate.</p>
<p>I want to tell you they are wrong. We will make Computerization great again by restoring the things we have lost.</p>
<p>The first thing is our value. There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Those who told you we
    cannot succeed because no one has ever done that before are the same ones who told you Computerization is a club
    reserved for stupid nerds. We once defied their expectation in this September. There is no reason that we should not
    do that again. That requires our teachers to spend time really thinking about what is the correct way to teach
    programming: not necessarily in the most precise words which can only be found in the textbooks of theoretical
    computer science, but in the vivid, everyday words, aided by useful examples and practice; not necessarily in the
    form of a teacher vs a bunch of sleepy students, but in the form of practice with the modern technology of
    Codecademy. Our teachers may assume that past success granted us the privilege to be lazy. It is complete nonsense.
    Computerization is strong if and only if we are smart. Teachers should not only perfunctorily perform the task and
    earn some meaningless service hours to fulfill the CAS requirement. They should be smart and creative, to challenge
    the conventional wisdom that computer science is hard to teach. However, that’s not sufficient. Our newly recruited
    members should also have a firm belief in their mind: computer science is not hard to learn. Five years ago, I was
    still a middle school student who did not even learn function in mathematics and tried hard to figure out the
    meaning of function in C++. It should not be a singular example; instead, it should be the collective story of
    Computerization.</p>
<p>The next thing is the respect of hard work and despises of mere talking. The programming class becomes a place of
    complaint and disappointment. The sentence I heard the most is “I cannot do it.” Yes, you never learned how to
    program unless you started to type the code in the programming book to see if it works. Computerization has provided
    a far more comfortable environment for members to learn. When I started to learn to program, I was frequently
    interrupted by mom because she thought it was a distraction from academics. No one can help me to fix any single
    bug. It is a completely different story in Computerization, and it does have a completely different but sad outside.
    You wasted the opportunities. I want members, lots of members in Computerization. However, they must remember one
    thing: work. Computerization is not a place of vainglory. We do not have an admission test like many other big clubs
    do because we believe it is the hard work rather than the previous knowledge that determines the outcome. Due to the
    special condition, I propose, to have a test to write down the code of primality test in the next session. The ones
    who succeed will be promoted to the development team to learn at a much faster rate. The ones who fail should be
    placed into another class and learn to appreciate hard work or choose to leave.</p>
<p>The most important thing is the determination to make things work and to make things great. We have forgotten the
    history of our progress. During the first three months of activity, we created SAM out of nothing except our
    knowledge and passion. Six months ago, I fought alone to refresh the look of SAM into the material design within one
    weekend. More importantly, the published versions DO NOT have bugs that undermine our reputation as a professional
    team. It is no longer the story, but it should be. In this week, I want to restore the prestige of Computerization
    by fixing all those bugs. We would not only fix them, but also make it great. That requires the members of the
    development team to pursue the state of perfection, not the state of the prototype. Also, we should not abandon the
    project for the research of artificial intelligence because it is hard. If you would abandon hard projects, how do
    you start to program? We should not be intimidated because the willingness to tackle the world class problem with
    make Computerization great and strong.</p>
<p>True, we have difficulties, but they are not permanent. As long as we can have a strong leadership that restores our
    belief, our spirit of hard work and determination, we will not be facing the same problems again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will make Computerization strong again.</p>
<p>We will make Computerization proud again.</p>
<p>We will make Computerization smart again.</p>
<p>And we will make Computerization great again.</p>
