Developer Sam Website (Backend)
===============================
The code of my own website that is now open-sourced.

This repository contains both the frontend and the backend. The frontend is 
now developed with Angular 5 and Angular Material 5. The backend is developed
by Kotlin.

Previously independently hosted MCTS and TEN-Board-Game has now been moved
into this repository for better integration with my website.
